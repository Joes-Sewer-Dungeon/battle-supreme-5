This is just for mounting content on hammer since it does not support the new filesystem.
You will see things in angle brackets <>, replace them with the paths that they are named after.
Example <path_to_tf2> will be D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2
Make sure to keep it within the quotes. Otherwise hammer will not recognize the path.

To setup hammer to use this, set it up how you normally would.
Just set the game folder to this folder.
Make sure hammer is configured so maps compile into the bs5 folder!
